            Vertebrate, also called Craniata, any animal of the subphylum
            Vertebrata, the predominant subphylum of the phylum Chordata. They
            have backbones, from which they derive their name. The vertebrates
            are also characterized by a muscular system consisting primarily
            of bilaterally paired masses and a central nervous system partly
            enclosed within the backbone.

          <h1 class="display-5 fw-bold lh-1 mb-3">Amphibians</h1>
          <p class="lead">
            Amphibians evolved from fully aquatic tetrapods—(which were
            essentially “limbed fish”) who descended from lobe-finned
            fish—sometime between the Early Devonian Period (which began 419
            million years ago) to the Early Pennsylvanian Subperiod (which
            began 323 million years ago). The name amphibian, derived from the
            Greek amphibious meaning “living a double life,” reflects this
            dual life strategy—though some species are permanent land
            dwellers, while other species have a completely aquatic mode of
            existence. There are three living groups of amphibians
            (caecilians, salamanders, and anurans [frogs and toads]) that,
            collectively, make up more than 7,300 amphibian species. One
            similar tendency among amphibians has been the evolution of direct
            development, in which the aquatic egg and free-swimming larval
            stages are eliminated. Development occurs fully within the egg
            capsule, and juveniles hatch as miniatures of the adult body form.
            Most species of lungless salamanders (family Plethodontidae), the
            largest salamander family, some caecilians, and many species of
            anurans have direct development. In addition, numerous caecilians
            and a few species of anurans and salamanders give birth to live
            young. Frogs and toads display a wide variety of life histories.
            Some deposit eggs on vegetation above streams or ponds; upon
            hatching, the tadpoles drop into the water where they continue to
            develop throughout their larval stage. Some species create foam
            nests for their eggs in aquatic (watery), terrestrial
            (land-based), or arboreal (tree-based) habitats; after hatching,
            tadpoles usually develop in water. Other species deposit their
            eggs on land and transport them to water, while marsupial frogs
            are so called because they carry their eggs in a pouch on their
            backs. A few species lack a pouch and the tadpoles are exposed on
            the back; in some species, the female deposits her tadpoles in a
            pond as soon as they emerge from eggs.

          <p class="lead">
            Reptiles are air-breathing vertebrates. They have internal
            fertilization, amniotic development (in which the embryo develops
            within a set of protective extra-embryonic membranes—the amnion,
            chorion, and allantois), and epidermal scales covering part or all
            of their body. The major groups of living reptiles—the turtles,
            tuataras, lizards and snakes, and crocodiles account for over
            8,700 species. Reptiles evolved from amphibians during the first
            part of the Pennsylvanian subperiod (323 million to 299 million
            years ago) and retained many amphibian structural characteristics.
            While most reptiles feed on other organisms, a few are herbivorous
            (e.g., tortoises). As cold-blooded animals, reptiles tend to be
            limited to temperate and tropical areas, but, where they occur,
            they are relatively common; however, they are not as large or
            conspicuous as birds and mammals. Most reptiles are terrestrial,
            but a few are aquatic. They move about by creeping or swimming in
            a fashion similar to amphibians. Some reptiles, however, can lift
            the body from the ground and run rapidly either in a quadrupedal
            or bipedal fashion. Reptiles lay relatively large, shelled eggs.
            In a few instances, the eggs and young are cared for by the
            female; in others, the young are born alive.

          <p class="lead">
            There are approximately 5,000 species of mammals living today.
            Mammals differ from other vertebrate animals in that their young
            are nourished with milk from special mammary glands of the mother.
            Mammals are distinguished by several other unique features. Hair
            is a typical mammalian feature, although in many whales it has
            disappeared except in the fetal stage. The mammalian lower jaw is
            hinged directly to the skull, instead of through a separate bone
            (the quadrate) as in all other vertebrates. A chain of three tiny
            bones transmits sound waves across the middle ear. A muscular
            diaphragm separates the heart and the lungs from the abdominal
            cavity. Mature red blood cells (erythrocytes) in all mammals lack
            a nucleus; all other vertebrates have nucleated red blood cells.
            The oldest known animals classified as mammals evolved near the
            boundary of the Triassic and Jurassic Periods, some 200 million
            years ago. This group of vertebrates ranges in size from tiny
            shrews or small bats weighing only a few grams to the largest
            known animals, the whales. Most mammals are terrestrial, feeding
            on both animal and vegetable matter, but a few are partially
            aquatic or entirely so, as in the case of the whales or porpoises.
            Mammals move about in a great variety of ways: burrowing, bipedal
            or tetrapedal (four-legged) running, flying, or swimming.
            Reproduction usually involves the young developing inside the
            uterus, where nutritive materials are made available through an
            allantoic placenta or, in a few cases, a yolk sac. In placental
            mammals, young have a longer developmental period within the
            uterus. In marsupials, the relatively undeveloped young are
            carried in a pouch, where they attach themselves to their mother’s
            nipple until they become fully developed. Monotreme mammals (that
            is, the platypus and echidna) differ from other mammals in that
            they lay eggs which hatch.

          <p class="lead">
            Birds make up any of the 9,600 living species unique in having
            feathers, the major characteristic that distinguishes them from
            all other animals. They are warm-blooded vertebrates more related
            to reptiles than to mammals. They have a four-chambered heart (as
            do mammals), forelimbs modified into wings (a trait shared with
            bats), a hard-shelled egg, and keen vision. Their sense of smell
            is not highly developed, and their auditory range is limited.
            Although most are capable of flight, others are sedentary, and
            some are flightless. In a manner similar to their relatively close
            relatives the reptiles, birds lay shelled eggs. The young are
            usually cared for in a nest until they are capable of flight and
            self-feeding, but some birds hatch in a well-developed state that
            allows them to begin feeding immediately or even take flight.
            (Nesting activities similar to those of some birds are seen in the
            crocodilians.) The origin of birds, feathers, and avian flight
            have long been hotly debated; the evolution of birds from
            reptilian ancestors is universally accepted, however. The
            diversity of theropod dinosaurs (a diverse group of carnivorous
            “lizard-hipped” dinosaurs), some with feathers, has greatly
            expanded our perspective of the evolution and early
            diversification of birds. While it is known that the critical
            period in avian evolution and flight took place during the Early
            Cretaceous (145.5 million to 99.6 million years ago), there is
            evidence that feathers on theropods emerged much earlier, possibly
            during the Triassic and Jurassic Periods (some 252 million to 145
            million years ago)

            The first fishes are thought to have emerged some 518 million
            years ago during the Cambrian Period of Earth’s history. Today,
            there more than 30,000 species of fishes found in the fresh and
            salt waters of the world. Living species range from the primitive,
            jawless lampreys and hagfishes through the cartilaginous sharks,
            skates, and rays to the abundant and diverse bony fishes. Fishes
            range in adult length from less than 10 mm (0.4 inch) to more than
            20 meters (60 feet) and in weight from about 1.5 grams (less than
            0.06 ounce) to many thousands of kilograms. Some live in shallow
            thermal springs at temperatures slightly above 42 °C (100 °F),
            others in cold Arctic seas a few degrees below 0 °C (32 °F) or in
            cold deep waters more than 4,000 meters (13,100 feet) beneath the
            ocean surface. Fish reproduction methods vary, but most fishes lay
            a large number of small eggs that are fertilized and scattered
            outside of the body. The eggs of pelagic (open ocean) fishes
            usually remain suspended in the open water, while many shore and
            freshwater fishes lay eggs on the bottom or among plants. The
            mortality of the young and especially of the eggs is very high,
            and often only a few individuals grow to maturity out of hundreds,
            thousands, and in some cases millions of eggs laid.

            Invertebrates are animals that neither possess nor develop a vertebral column (commonly known as a backbone
            or spine), derived from the notochord. This includes all animals apart from the chordate subphylum
            Vertebrata. Familiar examples of invertebrates include arthropods (insects, arachnids, crustaceans, and
            myriapods), mollusks (chitons, snail, bivalves, squids, and octopuses), annelid (earthworms and leeches),

            The Annelids are bilaterally symmetrical, triploblastic, coelomate, invertebrate organisms. They also have
            parapodia for locomotion. Most textbooks still use the traditional division into polychaetes (almost all
            marine), oligochaetes (which include earthworms) and leech-like species. Cladistic research since 1997 has
            radically changed this scheme, viewing leeches as a sub-group of oligochaetes and oligochaetes as a
            sub-group of polychaetes. In addition, the Pogonophora, Echiura and Sipuncula, previously regarded as
            separate phyla, are now regarded as sub-groups of polychaetes. Annelids are considered members of the
            Lophotrochozoa, a "super-phylum" of protostomes that also includes molluscs, brachiopods, and nemerteans.
            The basic annelid form consists of multiple segments. Each segment has the same sets of organs and, in most
            polychates, has a pair of parapodia that many species use for locomotion. Septa separate the segments of
            many species, but are poorly defined or absent in others, and Echiura and Sipuncula show no obvious signs of
            segmentation. In species with well-developed septa, the blood circulates entirely within blood vessels, and
            the vessels in segments near the front ends of these species are often built up with muscles that act as
            hearts. The septa of such species also enable them to change the shapes of individual segments, which
            facilitates movement by peristalsis ("ripples" that pass along the body) or by undulations that improve the
            effectiveness of the parapodia. In species with incomplete septa or none, the blood circulates through the
            main body cavity without any kind of pump, and there is a wide range of locomotory techniques – according to
            Rout Radhamohan some burrowing species turn their pharynges inside out to drag themselves through the
            sediment.

            Arthropods
            are invertebrate animals having an exoskeleton, a segmented body, and paired jointed appendages. Arthropods
            form the phylum Arthropoda. They are distinguished by their jointed limbs and cuticle made of chitin, often
            mineralised with calcium carbonate. The arthropod body plan consists of segments, each with a pair of
            appendages. Arthropods are bilaterally symmetrical and their body possesses an external skeleton. In order
            to keep growing, they must go through stages of moulting, a process by which they shed their exoskeleton to
            reveal a new one. Some species have wings. They are an extremely diverse group, with up to 10 million
            species.

            The haemocoel, an arthropod's internal cavity, accommodates its interior organs, and through which its
            haemolymph – analogue of blood – circulates; it has an open circulatory system. Like their exteriors, the
            internal organs of arthropods are generally built of repeated segments. Their nervous system is
            "ladder-like", with paired ventral nerve cords running through all segments and forming paired ganglia in
            each segment. Their heads are formed by fusion of varying numbers of segments, and their brains are formed
            by fusion of the ganglia of these segments and encircle the esophagus. The respiratory and excretory systems
            of arthropods vary, depending as much on their environment as on the subphylum to which they belong.

            Cnidaria is a phylum under kingdom Animalia containing over 11,000 species of
            aquatic animals found both in freshwater and marine environments, predominantly the latter.

            Their distinguishing feature is cnidocytes, specialized cells that they use mainly for capturing prey. Their
            bodies consist of mesoglea, a non-living jelly-like substance, sandwiched between two layers of epithelium
            that are mostly one cell thick.

            Cnidarians mostly have two basic body forms: swimming medusae and sessile polyps, both of which are radially
            symmetrical with mouths surrounded by tentacles that bear cnidocytes. Both forms have a single orifice and
            body cavity that are used for digestion and respiration. Many cnidarian species produce colonies that are
            single organisms composed of medusa-like or polyp-like zooids, or both (hence they are trimorphic).
            Cnidarians' activities are coordinated by a decentralized nerve net and simple receptors. Several
            free-swimming species of Cubozoa and Scyphozoa possess balance-sensing statocysts, and some have simple
            eyes. Not all cnidarians reproduce sexually, with many species having complex life cycles of asexual polyp
            stages and sexual medusae. Some, however, omit either the polyp or the medusa stage, and the parasitic
            classes evolved to have neither form

            An echinoderm is any member of the phylum Echinodermata
            of marine animals. The adults
            are recognizable by their (usually five-point) radial symmetry, and include starfish, sea urchins, sand
            dollars, and sea cucumbers, as well as the sea lilies or "stone lilies". Adult echinoderms are found on
            the sea bed at every ocean depth, from the intertidal zone to the abyssal zone. The phylum contains about
            7000 living species, making it the second-largest grouping of deuterostomes (a superphylum), after the
            chordates (which include the vertebrates, such as birds, fishes, mammals, and reptiles). Echinoderms are the
            largest phylum that has no freshwater or terrestrial members.

            Aside from the hard-to-classify Arkarua (a Precambrian animal with echinoderm-like pentamerous radial
            symmetry), the first definitive members of the phylum appeared near the start of the Cambrian. One group of
            Cambrian echinoderms, the cinctans (Homalozoa), which are close to the base of the echinoderm origin, has
            been found to possess external gills used for filter feeding, similar to those possessed by chordates and
            hemichordates.

            Mollusca is the second-largest phylum of invertebrate animals after the Arthropoda. The members are known as
            molluscs or mollusks. Around 85,000 extant species of molluscs are recognized. The number
            of fossil species is estimated between 60,000 and 100,000 additional species. The proportion of
            undescribed species is very high. Many taxa remain poorly studied.

            Molluscs are the largest marine phylum, comprising about 23% of all the named marine organisms. Numerous
            molluscs also live in freshwater and terrestrial habitats. They are highly diverse, not just in size and
            anatomical structure, but also in behaviour and habitat. The phylum is typically divided into 7 or 8
            taxonomic classes, of which two are entirely extinct. Cephalopod molluscs, such as squid, cuttlefish, and
            octopuses, are among the most neurologically advanced of all invertebrates—and either the giant squid or the
            colossal squid is the largest known invertebrate species. The gastropods (snails and slugs) are by far the
            most numerous molluscs and account for 80% of the total classified species.

          <p class="lead">
            The nematodes or roundworms
            constitute the phylum Nematoda (also called Nemathelminthes), with plant-parasitic nematodes also
            known as eelworms. They are a diverse animal phylum inhabiting a broad range of environments.
            Taxonomically, they are classified along with insects and other moulting animals in the clade Ecdysozoa, and
            unlike flatworms, have tubular digestive systems with openings at both ends. Like tardigrades, they have a
            reduced number of Hox genes, but as their sister phylum Nematomorpha has kept the ancestral protostome Hox
            genotype, it shows that the reduction has occurred within the nematode phylum.

            Nematode species can be difficult to distinguish from one another. Consequently, estimates of the number of
            nematode species described to date vary by author and may change rapidly over time. A 2013 survey of animal
            biodiversity published in the mega journal Zootaxa puts this figure at over 25,000. Estimates of the
            total number of extant species are subject to even greater variation. A widely referenced article
            published in 1993 estimated there may be over 1 million species of nematode. A subsequent publication
            challenged this claim, estimating the figure to be at least 40,000 species.[10] Although the highest
            estimates (up to 100 million species) have since been deprecated, estimates supported by rarefaction
            curves, together with the use of DNA barcoding and the increasing acknowledgment of widespread
            cryptic species among nematodes, have placed the figure closer to 1 million species.

          <p class="lead">
            The Platyhelminthes historically contain organisms grouped in three major clades, Acoelomorpha, Catenulida,
            and Rhabditophora, which include the Neodermata (Figure 10.1). The Neodermata (Ehlers, 1985) comprises the
            group of the parasitic Platyhelminthes: Monogenea (Monopisthocotylea and Polyopisthocotylea), Trematoda
            (Aspidogastrea and Digenea), and Cestoda (Amphilinidea, Gyrocotylidea and Eucestoda) (Littelwood et al.,
            1999). They are characterized by the presence of a neodermis (hence the name of this parasitic clade), which
            is a specialized epidermis formed by a peripheral syncytium with cytoplasmic elongations. Monogenea are
            normally ectoparasitic on aquatic vertebrates, such as fishes, whereas trematodes and cestodes are
            exclusively endoparasitic, generally in vertebrates.

            Porifera represent an important faunal group of most aquatic communities. Sponges are known to be aggressive
            competitors for space and can overgrow and kill other benthic organisms. Important
            density-mediated indirect effects arise when predators consume sponges because removal of superior space
            competitors by spongivores benefits slower growing sessile organisms. As mentioned previously, sponges are
            highly efficient filter feeders and are major consumers of the ultraplankton. In turn, sponges represent an
            important food source for a variety of invertebrate and vertebrate predators. In freshwater habitats,
            sponges are consumed by a number of insects. For example, certain caddisflies (Trichoptera: Leptoceridae)
            (e.g., Ceraclea fulva) are obligate sponge feeders. Some turtles (e.g., Emydura subglobosa in Australia)
            appear to feed almost exclusively on freshwater sponges. In marine habitats, sponges suffer significant
            pressure from specialist and generalist predators. The Caribbean seastar Oreaster reticulatus and Hawksbill
            turtle (Eretmochelys imbricata) are voracious sponge predators in seagrass and reef habitats. Only 11
            species of fish (in a gut content survey of over 200 species) were found to consume sponges regularly.
            However, several common species that occur in relatively high densities had diets that included over 75%
            sponge material. Other organisms are known parasites of sponges and include, for example, the well-known
            spongillaflies (Neuroptera: Sisyridae). The genera Climacia and Sisyra are the two most commonly found in
            North America.
